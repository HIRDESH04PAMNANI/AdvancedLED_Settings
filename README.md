📌 Project Overview

This project implements an advanced LED control system designed for microcontrollers. It provides a flexible framework for managing individual LEDs and LED groups, allowing for precise control over LED states, brightness levels, and colors.

🌟 Features

- 💡 Individual LED control (state, brightness, color)
- 🔗 LED group management
- 🏗️ Nested structure implementation for efficient memory usage
- 🚀 Pointer operations for performance optimization
- 📏 Scalable design for various embedded system applications

🛠 Technical Implementation

The system is built using C and showcases:

- Custom data structures (`LEDSettings` and `LEDGroup`)
- Function pointers for dynamic behavior
- Bitwise operations for color management
- Memory-efficient design suitable for resource-constrained environments

Core Components

1. `LEDSettings`: Structure for individual LED properties
2. `LEDGroup`: Structure for managing groups of LEDs
3. `initLEDGroup()`: Initializes default settings
4. `updateLEDGroupSettings()`: Updates LED and group settings
5. `displayLEDGroupStatus()`: Outputs current LED and group status

🛡 Edge Case Management

- Brightness Overflow: Capped at 255 to prevent overflow
- Color Value Validation: Ensures 24-bit color values
- State Consistency: Maintains consistency between individual and group states
- Memory Considerations: Uses uint8_t for most fields to minimize memory footprint


🔧 Customization for Specific Microcontrollers

- Replace `printf` statements with appropriate output methods (e.g., UART, I2C for LCD)
- Implement hardware-specific LED control functions
- Adjust data types if necessary for your specific microcontroller architecture
